// TODO:
//1. Override shake and add the capture + html generation over there
//2. Check if new code is generating the html correctly.
//3. Add accordion to the main contents. Already made in ChatGPT.
//4. Create the template manually. This will help to get more idea of the generation.
//5. Refactor the Screenshot logic and the detail capture logics. Looks over used.
